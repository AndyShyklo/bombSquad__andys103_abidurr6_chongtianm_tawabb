## Project 01: Topher Time by Bomb Squad

# Roster:
**Project Manager**: Andy Shyklo

**Website Developer/Frontend Designed/API Integrater:** Abidur Rahman

**Website Developer/Frontend Designed/API Integrater:** Mark Ma

**Backend/Database:** Tawab Berri


# Description:

  We are making our spinoff of Google's Santa Tracker, except we are “tracking” the one and only Topher Mykolyk as he travels around the world on his motorbike and delivers presents to worthy devos. We will write an algorithm that calculates the likelihood of countries that Topher visits on each day, based on several factors such as holiday, population, weather, etc. We will incorporate visual elements such as a calendar of celebrated holidays all around the world, a map of where topher is on each day, and an algorithm to predict where Topher is most likely to be.
